How did I insert that?How do I find the rows that have this date?",
        "You probably inserted the zero date at some time in the past when the MySQL Server configuration allowed it.Zero dates used to be allowed by default, and as of MySQL 5.7, they are not allowed by default. This is considered an improvement, because 0000-00-00 is not a valid date. I.e. it doesn't appear in any calendar.The configuration that determines whether these dates are allowed is the SQL mode NO_ZERO_DATE. When this mode is enabled, an SQL expression that casts '0000-00-00 00:00:00' as a datetime value returns an error.If that data is already stored in your table, you can at least fetch it. But you can't form a new value like that, including the literal value you used in your WHERE clause.To search for that value, you have to change your sql_mode configuration option, at least temporarily in the session where you run that query. I would recommend do not change it globally. It's a good thing to disallow invalid dates.The manual says:Because NO_ZERO_DATE is deprecated; expect it to be removed in a future release of MySQL as a separate mode name and its effect included in the effects of strict SQL mode.So in some future version of MySQL, you might have to disable strict mode to access such date values. I recommend you replace those values now with either some valid datetime value, or else NULL."

If my understanding of this data is also incorrect I'd be open to suggestions there too.If I do cut= YearsAtCompany - YearsWithCurrManager (or something along those lines) that's just going to create a vector of all of those differences in time, which isn't what I want."

",
        "There are multiple ways to submit a form from the browser:HTML form, submit button, user presses submit button, no Javascript involved.HTML form in the page, Javascript gets DOM element for the form and calls .submit() method on the form object.Ajax call using the XMLHttpRequest interface with the POST method and manually sending appropriate form data.Ajax Fetch call with the POST method and manually sending appropriate form data.With #1 or #2, the browser sends the form and the browser will pay attention to redirects and will display the form response (whether redirected or not) in the browser.With #3 and #4, the form is sent via Javascript and the response comes back to your Javascript.  #3 does not process redirects.  #4 has an option to process redirects. Here's more info on each of the above options.  #3 and #4 do not affect the browser display is not affected at all unless you program your own Javascript to process the request and affect the browser display (either by inserting content or setting window.location to a new URL. Here's some more info on the above schemes:Programmatic Ajax calls with XMLHttpRequest do not process redirects or the response from the Ajax call in any way.  They just return that response to YOUR Javascript. Keep in mind that a redirect is just one specific type of response you can get back from an Ajax call.  This is different than a browser submitted form POST.Programmatic Ajax calls with the fetch() interface offer an option to follow redirects automatically.  See the redirect option here.  But, even in this case, all the fetch() interface does is get the contents of the redirected URL.  It does not cause the browser page to change.  To so that, you would have to write your own Javascript code to either see the 3xx redirect response and then set window.location to the new redirect URL.  Or, you would have to let the interface follow the redirect automatically and then do something with the new redirected content that it will return to your Javascript.These programmatic requests different than letting the browser submit a form for you.  In the browser submitted case (without using Javascript to submit the form), the browser follows redirects and updates the display in the browser based on whatever content is returned from the form response.When you submit a form via Ajax, the browser does nothing automatically with the server response.  That response goes back to your Javascript and your script decides what to do with it.  If you want your script to follow redirects, then you have to examine the response, see if it's a 3xx status, get the new URL from the appropriate header and set window.location to that new URL. That will then cause the browser to display the redirect page.  But, you have to either program that yourself or find an Ajax library that offers a feature to do it form.  A standard Ajax call just returns the form POST response back to your Javascript - that's all.  Your script has to process that response and decide what to do next.I am confused, that I cannot call gateway using post API cause it won't redirect to new pageYou can.  You just need to write your own Javascript to process the response from the programmatic API call and, if its a 3xx redirect, then set window.location to the new URL to instruct the browser to load the new redirected page.",

        "I have a vector of character stacks called crates. Those stacks are represented using VecDeque<char> and thus the vector of those is a Vec<VecDeque<char>>. This data structure isn't really a stack but I'd like to use it as if it were one and just iterate through them from back to front and add elements to the back.I want to move k last chars of a stack to another, but I want to keep them in order.Example:stack_a = [ 1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4 ]stack_b = [ 5 <- 6 ]# movement from a to b with k=3stack_b = [ 5 <- 6 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4 ]You can notice that this is not something very easy to do with a stack. It would be easy if you had the right to change the order of elements added to the other stack because you could just repeat k times:push(stack_b, pop(stack_a))But here we need to reorder the calls, to pop k times, keep the k values in memory and then push them. This can easily be expressed with a recursive function.This is what my code looks like:// I'm extracting my stack ids from a regex capturelet source_id = usize::from_str(&cap[2]).unwrap() - 1;let target_id = usize::from_str(&cap[3]).unwrap() - 1;// My simple functionfn move_crates_simultaneously(    amount: usize,    source: Rev<Iter<char>>,    target: &mut VecDeque<char>,) {    if amount == 0 {        return;    }    let value = source.next();    move_crates_simultaneously(amount - 1, source, target);    target.push_back(*(value.unwrap()));}// My function callmove_crates_simultaneously(    usize::from_str(&cap[1]).unwrap(),    crates[source_id].iter().rev(),    &crates[target_id],);But there is a problem: &crates[target_id] is &VecDeque<char, Global> while the function needs a &mut VecDeque<char, Global>. From my understanding it doesn't seem to be possible to find a solution because there is now way for the compiler to know that my source and my target are not the same stack and thus to let me create my mutable ref for target. Does that mean it is not possible to solve this kind of problem that way in Rust?"

These are defined as defined as shape data and not as shape data set and can be accessed in formulas with the Prop.x notation.I have selected the master shape for editing from the stencil, opened it for editing, selected the shape and then selected from the menu bar / ribbon 'Insert -> Field', and have tried to display shape text by inserting a field with a custom formula:=IF(Prop.Display,IF(Prop.Type <> ,Prop.Type,),)The shape data field 'Display' is Boolean with default set to TRUE. The field 'Type' is a delimited list / dropdown that initially starts out blank.The objective is to have the user select a Type (when they know what it is), and the formula (in theory) should update the shape text to display that selection.The problem is that when I test the shape and make changes to either the Type field or the Display field nothing happens - no text is ever displayed.I'm sure that I am missing something simple here, but I cannot figure out what that is. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Any help greatly appreciated.CheersThe Frog"

I will note that it is saving as expected from within the admin portal.Here are my files:from django.db import modelsfrom django.contrib.auth import get_user_modelclass Profile(models.Model):    user = models.OneToOneField(get_user_model(), on_delete=models.CASCADE)    avatar = models.ImageField(default='avatars/Screenshot_2022-11-30_at_7.18.28_PM.png', upload_to='avatars/')    header = models.FileField(default='headers/Screenshot_2022-11-30_at_7.18.28_PM.png', upload_to='headers/')    followers = models.ManyToManyField(get_user_model(), related_name='followers', blank=True)from django.shortcuts import render, redirect, HttpResponseRedirectfrom django.contrib.auth import get_user_modelfrom django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView, Viewfrom django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixinfrom .models import Profiledef updateProf(request):    Profile.objects.filter(user_id=request.POST['user_id']).update(avatar=request.FILES['avatar'])    return HttpResponseRedirect(request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER')){% extends 'base.html' %}{% load crispy_forms_tags %}{% block content %}<div class=signup-form>    <h2>Edit profile</h2>    <form method=post action=/update-prof enctype=multipart/form-data>        {% csrf_token %}        <input type=hidden name=user_id value=2>        <input type=file name=avatar>        <button class=btn btn-success type=submit>Save changes</button>    </form></div>{% endblock %}And my settings/urls file:MEDIA_URL = '/media/'MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'] + static(    settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)I thought that adding the enctype field/request.FILES would solve the issue, but it didn't. Anyone know how I can get the file to save to avatars/ ?"
