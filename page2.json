Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post.Closed 7 mins ago.\r                        Improve this question\r                    Problem statement: Implement a class Point that has three properties and a method. All these attributes (properties and methods) should be public. This problem can be broken down into two tasks: Task 1: 👉 Implement a constructor to initialize the values of three properties: x, y, and z. Task 2: 👉 Implement a method, sqSum(), in the Point class which squares x, y, and z and returns their sum. Sample properties 1, 3, 5 Sample method output 35 Coding exercise Create a class Point with three properties: x, y, and z. class Point:   def __init__(self):       self.x = x       self.y = y       self.z = z   def sqSum(self):       passImplement the complete Student class by completing the tasks below Task 👉 Implement the following properties as private: • name • rollNumber 👉 Include the following methods to get and set the private properties above: • getName() • setName() • getRollNumber() • setRollNumber() 👉 Implement this class according to the rules of encapsulation. Input - Checking all the properties and methods Output - Expecting perfectly defined fields and getter/setters Note: Do not use initializers to initialize the properties. Use the set methods to do so. If the setter is not defined properly, the corresponding getter will also generate an error even if the getter is defined properly. Coding exercise class Student:   def setName(self):       pass   def getName(self):       pass   def setRollNumber(self):       pass   def getRollNumber(self):       pass3)Implement the basic structure of a parent class, Account, and a child class, SavingsAccount. Task 1 👉 Implement properties as instance variables, and set them to None or 0. Account has the following properties: • title • Balance SavingsAccount has the following properties: • interestRate Task 2 Create an initializer for Account class. The order of parameters should be the following, where Ashish is the title, and 5000 is the account balance: Account(Ashish, 5000) Task 3 Implement properties as instance variables, and set them to None or 0. Create an initializer for the SavingsAccount class using the initializer of the Account class in the order below: Account(Ashish, 5000, 5) Here, Ashish is the title and 5000 is the balance and 5 is the interestRate. Coding exercise class Account:   def __init__(self):       # write your code here       passclass SavingsAccount():   def __init__(self):       # write your code here       Pass4)Problem statement In this challenge, we will be extending the previous challenge and implementing methods in the parent class and its corresponding child class. The initializers for both classes have been defined for you. Task 1 In the Account class, implement the getBalance() method that returns balance. Task 2 In the Account class, implement the deposit(amount) method that adds amount to the balance. It does not return anything. Sample input balance = 2000 deposit(500) getbalance() Sample output 2500 Task 3 In the Account class, implement the withdrawal(amount) method that subtracts the amount from the balance. It does not return anything. Sample input balance = 2000 withdrawal(500) getbalance() Sample output 1500 Task 4 In the SavingsAccount class, implement an interestAmount() method that returns the interest amount of the current balance. Below is the formula for calculating the interest amount: Interest rate = interest rate *balance/100 Sample input balance = 2000 interestRate = 5 interestAmount() Sample output Note: A new SavingsClass object is initialized at the end of the code and test results will be based on it. class Account:   def __init__(self, title=None, balance=0):       self.title = title       self.balance = balance   def withdrawal(self, amount):       # write code here       pass   def deposit(self, amount):       # write code here       pass   def getBalance(self):       # write code here       passclass SavingsAccount(Account):   def __init__(self, title=None, balance=0, interestRate=0):           super().__init__(title, balance)           self.interestRate = interestRate    <br>   def interestAmount(self):       # write code here       pass#code to test - do not edit this <br>demo1 = SavingsAccount(Ashish, 2000, 5) # initializing a SavingsAccount object <br>Can anybody please help me in that"

So, when any web application run on 192.168.0.100:3000, then app will be accessible using the IP address of my router over internet like http://beta.example.com.But, when port 3000 is closed browser loads for almost 30 seconds then shows the message This site can't be reached.So, I want to create a Javascript server which will run on another domain or sub-domain then it will check if that IP address is online then redirect the Application running on it and if it is offline then show an static webpage.",
        "To create a javascript server that runs on another domain or subdomain and checks if an IP address is online, you can use the Node.js http module to create a server that listens for HTTP requests and responds accordingly. Here is an example of how you might implement this:const http = require('http');const dns = require('dns');// Replace with the IP address you want to checkconst targetIP = '1.2.3.4';http.createServer((req, res) => {  // Check if the target IP address is online  dns.lookup(targetIP, (err, address) => {    if (err) {      // If the IP address is offline, show a static webpage      res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});      res.write('<h1>Sorry, the target IP address is offline</h1>');      res.end();    } else {      // If the IP address is online, redirect to the application running on it      res.writeHead(302, {Location: `http://${targetIP}`});      res.end();    }  });}).listen(80); // Listen for HTTP requests on port 80This server listens for HTTP requests on port 80, and checks if the target IP address is online using the dns.lookup() function. If the IP address is online, the server sends a redirect response to the browser, pointing it to the application running on the target IP address. If the IP address is offline, the server sends a response with a static HTML page that informs the user that the target IP address is offline.Note that this server will only work if the target IP address is running a web server that is accessible from the internet. You may also need to configure your DNS settings and/or firewall to allow incoming traffic to the server."

        "What does ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException mean and how do I get rid of it? Here is a code sample that triggers the exception:String[] names = { tom, bob, harry };for (int i = 0; i <= names.length; i++) {    System.out.println(names[i]);}",
        "Your first port of call should be the documentation which explains it reasonably clearly:Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.So for example:int[] array = new int[5];int boom = array[10]; // Throws the exceptionAs for how to avoid it... um, don't do that. Be careful with your array indexes.One problem people sometimes run into is thinking that arrays are 1-indexed, e.g.int[] array = new int[5];// ... populate the array here ...for (int index = 1; index <= array.length; index++){    System.out.println(array[index]);}That will miss out the first element (index 0) and throw an exception when index is 5. The valid indexes here are 0-4 inclusive. The correct, idiomatic for statement here would be:for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++)(That's assuming you need the index, of course. If you can use the enhanced for loop instead, do so.)",
        "if (index < 0 || index >= array.length) {    // Don't use this index. This is out of bounds (borders, limits, whatever).} else {    // Yes, you can safely use this index. The index is present in the array.    Object element = array[index];}See also:The Java Tutorials - Language Basics - ArraysUpdate: as per your code snippet, for (int i = 0; i<=name.length; i++) {The index is inclusive the array's length. This is out of bounds. You need to replace <= by <.for (int i = 0; i < name.length; i++) {",
        "From this excellent article: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in for loopTo put it briefly:In the last iteration offor (int i = 0; i <= name.length; i++) {i will equal name.length which is an illegal index, since array indices are zero-based.Your code should readfor (int i = 0; i < name.length; i++)                   ^",
        "It means that you are trying to access an index of an array which is not valid as it is not in between the bounds.For example this would initialize a primitive integer array with the upper bound 4.int intArray[] = new int[5];Programmers count from zero. So this for example would throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException as the upper bound is 4 and not 5.intArray[5];",
        "What causes ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?If you think of a variable as a box where you can place a value, then an array is a series of boxes placed next to eachother, where the number of boxes is a finite and explicit integer.Creating an array like this:final int[] myArray = new int[5]creates a row of 5 boxes, each holding an int. Each of the boxes have an index, a position in the series of boxes. This index starts at 0, and ends at N-1, where N is the size of the array (the number of boxes).To retrieve one of the values from this series of boxes, you can refer to it through its index, like this:myArray[3]Which will give you the value of the 4th box in the series (since the first box has index 0).An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is caused by trying to retrive a box that does not exist, by passing an index that is higher than the index of last box, or negative.With my running example, these code snippets would produce such an exception:myArray[5] //tries to retrieve the 6th box when there is only 5myArray[-1] //just makes no sensemyArray[1337] //waay to highHow to avoid ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionIn order to prevent ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, there are some key points to consider:LoopingWhen looping through an array, always make sure that the index you are retrieving is strictly smaller than the length of the array (the number of boxes). For instance:for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {Notice the <, never mix a = in there..You might want to be tempted to do something like this:for (int i = 1; i <= myArray.length; i++) {    final int someint = myArray[i - 1]Just don't. Stick to the one above (if you need to use the index) and it will save you a lot of pain.Where possible, use foreach:for (int value : myArray) {This way you won't have to think about indexes at all.When looping, whatever you do, NEVER change the value of the loop iterator (here: i). The only place this should change value is to keep the loop going. Changing it otherwise is just risking an exception, and is in most cases not neccessary.Retrieval/updateWhen retrieving an arbitrary element of the array, always check that it is a valid index against the length of the array:public Integer getArrayElement(final int index) {    if (index < 0 || index >= myArray.length) {        return null; //although I would much prefer an actual exception being thrown when this happens.    }    return myArray[index];}",
        "To avoid an array index out-of-bounds exception, one should use the enhanced-for statement where and when they can.The primary motivation (and use case) is when you are iterating and you do not require any complicated iteration steps.  You would not be able to use an enhanced-for to move backwards in an array or only iterate on every other element.You're guaranteed not to run out of elements to iterate over when doing this, and your [corrected] example is easily converted over.The code below:String[] name = {tom, dick, harry};for(int i = 0; i< name.length; i++) {    System.out.print(name[i] + \\n);}...is equivalent to this:String[] name = {tom, dick, harry};for(String firstName : name) {    System.out.println(firstName + \\n);}",
        "In your code you have accessed the elements from index 0 to the length of the string array. name.length gives the number of string objects in your array of string objects i.e. 3, but you can access only up to index 2 name[2],because the array can be accessed from index 0 to name.length - 1 where you get name.length number of objects.Even while using a for loop you have started with index zero and you should end with name.length - 1. In an array a[n] you can access form a[0] to a[n-1].For example:String[] a={str1, str2, str3 ..., strn};for(int i=0; i<a.length(); i++)    System.out.println(a[i]);In your case:String[] name = {tom, dick, harry};for(int i = 0; i<=name.length; i++) {    System.out.print(name[i] +'\\n');}",
        "For your given array the length of the array is 3(i.e. name.length = 3). But as it stores element starting from index 0, it has max index 2.So, instead of  'i**<=name.length' you should write 'i<**name.length' to avoid 'ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException'.",
        "So much for this simple question, but I just wanted to highlight a new feature in Java which will avoid all confusions around indexing in arrays even for beginners. Java-8 has abstracted the task of iterating for you.int[] array = new int[5];//If you need just the itemsArrays.stream(array).forEach(item -> { println(item); });//If you need the index as wellIntStream.range(0, array.length).forEach(index -> { println(array[index]); })What's the benefit? Well, one thing is the readability like English. Second, you need not worry about the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException",
        "The most common case I've seen for seemingly mysterious ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions, i.e. apparently not caused by your own array handling code, is the concurrent use of SimpleDateFormat. Particularly in a servlet or controller:public class MyController {  SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(MM/dd/yyyy);  public void handleRequest(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res) {    Date date = dateFormat.parse(req.getParameter(date));  }}If two threads enter the SimplateDateFormat.parse() method together you will likely see an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Note the synchronization section of the class javadoc for SimpleDateFormat.Make sure there is no place in your code that are accessing thread unsafe classes like SimpleDateFormat in a concurrent manner like in a servlet or controller. Check all instance variables of your servlets and controllers for likely suspects.",
        "You are getting ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException due to i<=name.length part. name.length return the length of the string name, which is 3. Hence when you try to access name[3], it's illegal and throws an exception.Resolved code:String[] name = {tom, dick, harry};for(int i = 0; i < name.length; i++) { //use < insteadof <=  System.out.print(name[i] +'\\n');}It's defined in the Java language specification:The public final field length, which contains the number of components  of the array. length may be positive or zero.",
        "That's how this type of exception looks when thrown in Eclipse. The number in red signifies the index you tried to access. So the code would look like this:myArray[5]The error is thrown when you try to access an index which doesn't exist in that array. If an array has a length of 3,int[] intArray = new int[3];then the only valid indexes are:intArray[0]intArray[1]intArray[2]If an array has a length of 1,int[] intArray = new int[1];then the only valid index is:intArray[0]Any integer equal to the length of the array, or bigger than it: is out of bounds.Any integer less than 0: is out of bounds;P.S.: If you look to have a better understanding of arrays and do some practical exercises, there's a video here: tutorial on arrays in Java",
        "For multidimensional arrays, it can be tricky to make sure you access the length property of the right dimension. Take the following code for example:int [][][] a  = new int [2][3][4];for(int i = 0; i < a.length; i++){    for(int j = 0; j < a[i].length; j++){        for(int k = 0; k < a[j].length; k++){            System.out.print(a[i][j][k]);        }        System.out.println();    }    System.out.println();}Each dimension has a different length, so the subtle bug is that the middle and inner loops use the length property of the same dimension (because a[i].length is the same as a[j].length).Instead, the inner loop should use a[i][j].length (or a[0][0].length, for simplicity).",
        "For any array of length n, elements of the array will have an index from 0 to n-1.If your program is trying to access any element (or memory) having array index greater than n-1, then Java will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionSo here are two solutions that we can use in a programMaintaining count:for(int count = 0; count < array.length; count++) {    System.out.println(array[count]);}Or some other looping statement likeint count = 0;while(count < array.length) {    System.out.println(array[count]);    count++;}A better way go with a for each loop, in this method a programmer has no need to bother about the number of elements in the array.for(String str : array) {    System.out.println(str);}",
        "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException whenever this exception is coming it mean you are trying to use an index of array which is out of its bounds or in lay man terms you are requesting more than than you have initialised.To prevent this always make sure that you are not requesting a index which is not present in array i.e. if array length is 10 then your index must range between 0 to 9",
        "ArrayIndexOutOfBounds means you are trying to index a position within an array that is not allocated.In this case:String[] name = { tom, dick, harry };for (int i = 0; i <= name.length; i++) {    System.out.println(name[i]);}name.length is 3 since the array has been defined with 3 String objects.When accessing the contents of an array, position starts from 0. Since there are 3 items, it would mean name[0]=tom, name[1]=dick and name[2]=harryWhen you loop, since i can be less than or equal to name.length, you are trying to access name[3] which is not available.To get around this... In your for loop, you can do i < name.length. This would prevent looping to name[3] and would instead stop at name[2]for(int i = 0; i<name.length; i++)Use a for each loopString[] name = { tom, dick, harry };for(String n : name) {    System.out.println(n);}Use list.forEach(Consumer action) (requires Java8)String[] name = { tom, dick, harry };Arrays.asList(name).forEach(System.out::println);Convert array to stream - this is a good option if you want to perform additional 'operations' to your array e.g. filter, transform the text, convert to a map etc (requires Java8)String[] name = { tom, dick, harry };---  Arrays.asList(name).stream().forEach(System.out::println);---  Stream.of(name).forEach(System.out::println);",

I use the Collections classes, which avoids all the silliness of having to deal with array indices entirely.  The looping constructs work beautifully with collections supporting code that is both easier to write, understand and maintain.",
        "If you use an array's length to control iteration of a for loop, always remember that the index of the first item in an array is 0. So the index of the last element in an array is one less than the array's length.",
        "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException name itself explains that If you trying to access the value at the index which is out of the scope of Array size then such kind of exception occur. In your case, You can just remove equal sign from your for loop.for(int i = 0; i<name.length; i++)The better option is to iterate an array: for(String i : name )      System.out.println(i);",
        "This error is occurs at runs loop  overlimit times.Let's consider simple example like this,class demo{  public static void main(String a[]){    int[] numberArray={4,8,2,3,89,5};    int i;    for(i=0;i<numberArray.length;i++){        System.out.print(numberArray[i+1]+  );    }}At first, I have initialized an array as 'numberArray'. then , some array elements are printed using for loop. When loop is running 'i' time , print the (numberArray[i+1] element..(when i value is 1, numberArray[i+1] element is printed.)..Suppose that, when i=(numberArray.length-2), last element of array is printed..When 'i' value goes to (numberArray.length-1) , no value for printing..In that point , 'ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException' is occur.I hope to you could get idea.thank you !",

        "I'm using Scrapy to collect about 150 attributes for Cloud Services listed on the UK Gov Digital Marketplace (G-Cloud). The catalogue holds details of about 40,000 services accessed through summary pages with 30 products to a page (1,355 pages). Things have been going fine for 5 or 6 years. Now the catalogue has been moved to a new URL. I have repaired all the Xpaths and tested and I am getting all the data I need when a product is hit.But comparing my downloaded product count to the total on the catalogue, I am getting only 30,000 products - missing 25%.custom_settings includes 'AUTOTHROTTLE_START_DELAY': .5,'AUTOTHROTTLE_MAX_DELAY': 60,Would changing these settings improve my harvest?What else can you suggest may be impacting my low yield?For completeness, here is the pagination function, which seems to work effectively, so I don't think the fault lies here:    def parse(self, response):        for link in response.xpath('//h2/a/@href').getall():            yield scrapy.Request(response.urljoin(link), callback=self.parse_item)        next_page = response.xpath('//li[@class=dm-pagination__item dm-pagination__item--next]/a/@href').get()        if next_page:            yield scrapy.Request(response.urljoin(next_page), callback=self.parse)Historically, I never get the full product count as a small number are suspended for editing or deletion. But this would be less then 1%. The script takes roughly 15 hours to run from my desktop. I am running the script repeatedly to see if the outcome is consistent and if the missing products are always the same ones. Due to the long run-time it will be a week or so before I have sufficient data to draw a conclusion.As you can tell, I'm a novice with Scrapy. The original script was written for me but the author is no longer contactable. So I have kluged the script to get good test results but for this one problem of a low yield.Thanks for your helpInSadly"
