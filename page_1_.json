Mind how low the scroll bar can slide (30+ GAS files) ↓ In Apps Script, .gs files cannot be manually mixed like .js modules, which means I cannot import or export (right?), neither control what will be shown when you serach for completions;Eventually, my globalspace has gotten heavily poluted with tons of Functions;  The scenario is: I usually forget what Functions do, or even that they exist (so many times I coded something that was ready, but lost amongst all other Functions);Of course wrapping similar functions around interfaces would solve it, but with .gs files, it often leads to +1000 lines files and negatively affects the project's readability (believe me, I tried);I've found no Youtube videos, questions in forums or anything like it anywhere on the internet that talks about how to deal with it, so the question is:How do I clean up my global space without having to create +1000 lines .gs filesArticles, blogs, videos etc. are welcome."

I already examine the logs from the XCode terminal and the Console app with Simulator + Real Device, let me share my piece of code on logging.let logger = Logger(subsystem: com.myname.LogExample, category: ViewController)let appName = LogExamplelet numberToBePrivate = 35logger.notice(Hello, this is default message)logger.notice(Hello again, this is default message with private integer of \\(numberToBePrivate, privacy: .private))logger.log(Hello, my name is \\(appName, privacy: .private))And my logs, the outputs of the XCode terminal2022-12-07 01:30:14.372319+0200 LogExample[62053:2356742] [ViewController] Hello, this is default message2022-12-07 01:30:14.372816+0200 LogExample[62053:2356742] [ViewController] Hello again, this is default message with private integer of 352022-12-07 01:30:14.372921+0200 LogExample[62053:2356742] [ViewController] Hello, my name is LogExampleAnd in the Console appWhat I expect is a total <private> mark on the message of set private privacy sections, which is the expected one.As I know, the output in the Console.app for the second log should be exact like this:Hello again, this is default message with private integer of <private>As I said before, I tried both the simulator + real device and the behavior of the Logger is totally the same. If I am doing anything wrong, I would like to learn it or any idea which useful would be super cool.PS: notice and log function is the same level, notice basically is the default log level, and when you don't describe the level in the log function, it is described as default, so they are basically the same. And they are supposed be persisted.Thanks"

        "I'm still new at dev with CosmosDB, Quarkus, and Vertx and am seeking some clarification - originally I ran into errors with the Quarkus native build as specified in this GitHub issue and according to the reply, I assumed it referred to the CosmosAsyncClient that we use as the culprit of issues when trying to build the native image. Per the reply, I found this project and used mvn clean install to build locally (couldn't be found in the remote repository?) and added the following dependency for what I think is the extension that was being referred to in my project's pom:<dependency>    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.azureservices</groupId>    <artifactId>quarkus-azure-http-client-vertx</artifactId>    <version>999-SNAPSHOT</version></dependency>But I am currently unsure of how to go from here in order to use the HTTP/Web client to communicate with CosmosDB (e.g. CosmosAsyncClientBuilder uses endpoint() and key() - are there equivalents/how can I use this in the HTTPClient context?) and the specific containers I need to query.So far I've created a Vertx from the QuarkusVertxProvider and then a WebClient from that Vertx but I'm currently stuck with how I would go about sending queries to the database and the specific containers I want to use in CosmosDB without relying on classes from com.azure.cosmos, as later I want to be able to run the native build. Has anyone had success in using Web/HTTPClient instead of CosmosAsyncClient, or is this not possible?If there are different suggestions for any Quarkus extensions I may have missed that is better suited for what I'm trying to do, please let me know. I have briefly worked with the reactive postgreSQL and mongoDB and the tutorials were easy to understand and showed how we could specify the database connection e.g. in our properties file, but I don't know what is the equivalent for this with Cosmos."

I am unsure how to. I expected  it to use a PS/2 type connection, as it has six pins (forgive me as I am not experienced at hardware). Unfortunately, while I identified the +5v and GND pins, I am unsure of the rest. Upon looking at a schematic, none of the pins seem to match up with the PS/2 pinout. Can you help me interface with this track pad?Model # (of track pad): 8SST60V07208PS: the ribbon cable connector of the track pad is broken, but I can solder in a replacement"

If the same steps are done in Azure DevOps and the package is published to our private/company feed, debugging does not work (the code steps through the package code without going in).Here's what I've done to enable debugging.In the class library being packaged, installed Microsoft.SourceLink.GitHub packages to generate source link for GitHub repository (our code is there).In VS, in Options->Debugging unchecked Enable Just My Code.I build a release configuration of the package either using VS build or msbuild (makes no differencce). Then I use Package Manager Console to build the package (i.e., nuget pack [path to project file] -properties configuration=Release). When I add this locally build package, debugging works just fine. My assumption is the above source link package points to the location in the repository. There's no pdb anywhere so, since everything works fine, I'm assuming it's not needed.If the same steps are done on Azure Devops server, the package is published to the company's private feed and added to the consuming project from there, debugging does not work. You'd think with the project file being the same, debugging should work regardless where you built it.I've tried to add Index sources and publish symbols step per these instructions  but it makes no difference. I also tried making the below change to the project file setting DebuggingSymbols=true and DebugType=Full. This didn't make any difference either. <PropertyGroup Condition= '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Release|AnyCPU' >    <DebugType>full</DebugType>    <Optimize>true</Optimize>    <OutputPath>bin\\Release\\</OutputPath>    <DefineConstants>TRACE</DefineConstants>    <ErrorReport>prompt</ErrorReport>    <WarningLevel>4</WarningLevel>    <Prefer32Bit>false</Prefer32Bit>    <DebugSymbols>true</DebugSymbols>  </PropertyGroup>Please share your ideas!"

        "The testbench code has a simulation race condition.  The 1st $display statement executes at time 0.  Also at time 0 a, b and cin start with their initial value of x because reg types are initialized to x (the unknown value).  Again at time 0, you change the values of these 3 signals to known values (a = 8'b11110000, etc.).  Since these 3 things occur during the same time step, the result is indeterminate.One way to get the result you want is to add a delay before the 1st $display statement, such as #1.A similar reason applies for the 2nd $display statement; to fix that, also add delay.  Here is modified code that produces the desired result:  initial begin    $dumpfile(dump.vcd);    $dumpvars(1);    //With Carry    a = 8'b11110000;    b = 8'b11001100;    cin = 0;    #1;    $display(In the case involving carry, For A = %8b, B = %8b, and Cin = %1d: the Sum will be %8b and Cout will be %1d., a, b, cin, sum, cout);    #20;    //Without Carry    a = 8'b11110000;    b = 8'b00001101;    cin = 0;    #1;    $display(In the case without involving carry, For A = %8b, B = %8b, and Cin = %1d: the Sum will be %8b and Cout will be %1d., a, b, cin, sum, cout);    #100;  endOutput:In the case involving carry, For A = 11110000, B = 11001100, and Cin = 0: the Sum will be 10111100 and Cout will be 1.In the case without involving carry, For A = 11110000, B = 00001101, and Cin = 0: the Sum will be 11111101 and Cout will be 0.Another approach is to use a single $monitor statement instead of multiple $display statements:  initial begin    $dumpfile(dump.vcd);    $dumpvars(1);    $monitorb(a,, b,, cin,, sum,, cout);    //With Carry    a = 8'b11110000;    b = 8'b11001100;    cin = 0;    #20;    //Without Carry    a = 8'b11110000;    b = 8'b00001101;    cin = 0;    #100;  endOut:11110000 11001100 0 10111100 111110000 00001101 0 11111101 0See also $strobe"
