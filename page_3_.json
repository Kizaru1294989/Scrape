However, this doesnot even call the alert function",
        "A few things to note here without having much context on the rest of your code:You're listening for a submit event on what appears to be a button, but submit events only fire on form elements. Read more in MDN.You're running an alert in the submit event handler, an alert won't do anything to show or hide your button, it will only show a browser alert with the string passed to it in the parenthesis. More on that in MDN.Depending on when your code runs, adding an event listener to DOMContentLoaded (MDN) may not do anything, it may be best to start with the button hidden, and then add a class to it to show it when appropriate. The class must be targeted by some CSS, of course.Here's my shot in the dark at addressing the high level idea you're expressing here:const form = document.getElementById('signupform');const pdfButton = document.getElementById('pdfdownloadbutton');form.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {  // preventDefault added to be able to show the button in this example  event.preventDefault();  pdfButton.classList.add('show');});Additionally, you'll need some CSS for the code above to work:#pdfdownloadbutton {  visibility: hidden;}#pdfdownloadbutton.show {  visibility: visible;}You can see it in action in this Codepen.Note that your code doesn't give the full content so I had to fill in the blanks. Particularly, notice how I added event.preventDefault() (MDN) because the normal behavior of a submit event would load a new page, so you should consider if this is happening on your site in which case you may need a different solution than your current approach."

        "What does sys.stdout.flush() do?",
        "Python's standard out is buffered (meaning that it collects some of the data written to standard out before it writes it to the terminal). Calling sys.stdout.flush() forces it to flush the buffer, meaning that it will write everything in the buffer to the terminal, even if normally it would wait before doing so.  Here's some good information about (un)buffered I/O and why it's useful:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_bufferBuffered vs unbuffered IO",
        "Consider the following simple Python script:import timeimport sysfor i in range(5):    print(i),    #sys.stdout.flush()    time.sleep(1)This is designed to print one number every second for five seconds, but if you run it as it is now (depending on your default system buffering) you may not see any output until the script completes, and then all at once you will see 0 1 2 3 4 printed to the screen.This is because the output is being buffered, and unless you flush sys.stdout after each print you won't see the output immediately.  Remove the comment from the sys.stdout.flush() line to see the difference.",
        "As per my understanding, When ever we execute print statements output will be written to buffer. And we will see the output on screen when buffer get flushed(cleared). By default buffer will be flushed when program exits. BUT WE CAN ALSO FLUSH THE BUFFER MANUALLY by using sys.stdout.flush() statement in the program. In the below code buffer will be flushed when value of i reaches 5.You can understand by executing the below code.chiru@online:~$ cat flush.pyimport timeimport sysfor i in range(10):    print i    if i == 5:        print Flushing buffer        sys.stdout.flush()    time.sleep(1)for i in range(10):    print i,    if i == 5:        print Flushing buffer        sys.stdout.flush()chiru@online:~$ python flush.py 0 1 2 3 4 5 Flushing buffer6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 Flushing buffer6 7 8 9",
        "import sysfor x in range(10000):    print HAPPY >> %s <<\\r % str(x),    sys.stdout.flush()",
        "As per my understanding sys.stdout.flush() pushes out all the data that has been buffered to that point to a file object.While using stdout, data is stored in buffer memory (for some time or until the memory gets filled) before it gets written to terminal. Using flush() forces to empty the buffer and write to terminal even before buffer has empty space.",
        "You can see the differences b/w these twoimport sysfor i in range(1,10 ):    sys.stdout.write(str(i))    sys.stdout.flush()for i in range(1,10 ):    print iIn the first case, the characters are output one by one after each is written, because of the flush.  In the second case, the characters are buffered by Python until it thinks it's got something worth the effort to write, and then written all in a batch.If you add, say,  a time.sleep(0.2) in the loops, this becomes more obvious."

    "contenus": [
        "We use ajax in a number of places on our website. One instance sometimes acts irregularly as if the ajax call failed. It is just in one particular location--all the others work as expected.When the failure occurs, the user gets an error message that the operation failed.We cannot reproduce the failure. It always just works for us. Most users do not experience the issue. The few that do sometimes report that they tried it again later and it worked.We can simulate the failure by renaming the ajax script. Then when the operation is attempted, the ajax call fails and we get the same error message. Yet we don't have any reason to believe that the error is caused by inability to access the ajax script, although it could be. If that were the case, then the same issue should occur with our other ajax scripts.We have come up with a workaround. If the user goes into incognito mode before attempting the operation, the problem is avoided.The incognito mode workaround suggests that it might be related to a cookie. Accordingly, we have attempted to interfere with cookies in some way to try to recreate the problem. Nothing has succeeded.To assist with troubleshooting, we have added additional diagnostic information to the error message, but so far nothing has come out of this other than information similar to Error. Here is some code that shows how we are trying to get more information:error: function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown){    // alert('read-unread error');    ajaxError('Read-Unread', textStatus, errorThrown);  // TODO comment out to suppress the error reporting},For completeness, I have included the full javascript function below.To set up a simple test environment to demonstrate the issue will not work very well, as it would simplify so much from the real environment as to destroy its test value. We think the only reasonable test would be to simulate a use case as the users are doing. Unfortunately that is complex, as it involves by creating a profile on our system, attempting to use the system to communicate with other members, having some response communication from the other members and then try to reply to such a communication. That re-creates the the use case, and the place where the failure occurs. Again, unfortunately, we suspect that it would still never trigger the failure for us--the toy system would also just work.It would be one thing it it happened to every user every time, but it does not. Only some users some of the time, and only for one ajax usage out of many on our site. Once it starts happening, at least for a while it is repeatable for that user.My questions:How could we create a stripped down version of the environment so we could make it worthwhile for the stackoverflow community to take a look at it, short of simulating use of our website?Does the incognito mode workaround provide any insight to understand what is going wrong?Apart from diagnosing code that in most cases works correctly, it would be helpful to get insight on other ajax failure modes. As a made up example, such as certain systems are too slow and the ajax times out.[The javascript function.

But I cannot connect those concepts to what we have here. In other words, what '*' an '&' do when I use them in function declaration in Go.I know what reference and dereference mean. I cannot understand how we can use a pointer to a function in Go? For example lines 1 and 7, what do these two lines do? The function named intial1 is declared that returns a pointer? And in line 7, we call it with arguments using the return function.",
        "This is possibly one of the most confusing things in Go.  There are basically 3 cases you need to understand:The & Operator& goes in front of a variable when you want to get that variable's memory address.The * Operator* goes in front of a variable that holds a memory address and resolves it (it is therefore the counterpart to the & operator).  It goes and gets the thing that the pointer was pointing at, e.g. *myString.myString := Hifmt.Println(*&myString)  // prints Hior more usefully, something likemyStructPointer = &myStruct// ...(*myStructPointer).someAttribute = New Value* in front of a TypeWhen * is put in front of a type, e.g. *string, it becomes part of the type declaration, so you can say this variable holds a pointer to a string. For example:var str_pointer *stringSo the confusing thing is that the * really gets used for 2 separate (albeit related) things.  The star can be an operator or part of a type.",
        "Your question doesn't match very well the example given but I'll try to be straightforward.Let's suppose we have a variable named a which holds the integer 5 and another variable named p which is going to be a pointer.This is where the * and & come into the game.Printing variables with them can generate different output, so it all depends on the situation and how well you use.The use of * and & can save you lines of code (that doesn't really matter in small projects) and make your code more beautiful/readable.& returns the memory address of the following variable.* returns the value of the following variable (which should hold the memory address of a variable, unless you want to get weird output and possibly problems because you're accessing your computer's RAM)var a = 5var p = &a // p holds variable a's memory addressfmt.Printf(Address of var a: %p\\n, p)fmt.Printf(Value of var a: %v\\n, *p)// Let's change a value (using the initial variable or the pointer)*p = 3 // using pointera = 3 // using initial varfmt.Printf(Address of var a: %p\\n, p)fmt.Printf(Value of var a: %v\\n, *p)All in all, when using * and & in remember that * is for setting the value of the variable you're pointing to and & is the address of the variable you're pointing to/want to point to.Hope this answer helps. ",
        "Those are pointers like we have in C++.The differences are:Instead of -> to call a method on a pointer, you always  use ., i.e. pointer.method().There are no dangling pointers. It is perfectly valid to return a pointer to a local variable. Golang will ensure the lifetime of the object and garbage-collect it when it's no longer needed.Pointers can be created with new() or by creating a object object{} and taking the address of it with &.Golang does not allow pointer-arithmetic (arrays do not decay to pointers) and insecure casting. All downcasts will be checked using the runtime-type of the variable and either panic or return false as second return-value when the instance is of the wrong type, depending on whether you actually take the second return type or not.",

Here it just represents the variable that is passed as a parameter is the address of type int.func zero(xPtr *int) {  *xPtr = 0}func main() {  x := 5  zero(&x)  fmt.Println(x) // x is 0}",
