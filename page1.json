        "I've been creating my own databases for use in personal projects. While the use cases are pretty low load, I want to make sure my SQL queries are as efficient as possible. I would consider myself an intermediate user of SQL.The situation is this: I am using a local app that will send queries to the database. Each query should adhere to its own data contract when returning data. For this one in particular, I want to get a table row based on a UNIQUE ID. If the ID does not yet exist in the table, the query should create a new row and then also return it.The most common solution I've seen is something like thisIF NOT EXISTS( SELECT id FROM table_a WHERE id = my_id)THENINSERT INTO table_a ... RETURNING *ELSESELECT * FROM table_a WHERE id = my_idENDThis seems fine, but I feel like I am performing the same SELECT twice, once to check if the row exists and again to get the row when it does.Then there's thisWITH cte AS (    INSERT INTO table_a ... RETURNING * ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING)// Then do branching logic here depending on the result of cte, also not too clear on how best to perform thatThis also seems good, but 1. It feels weird to catch an error on an INSERT rather than checking beforehand, especially when 2. in my use case the INSERT option would happen 1/10000 times this query runs.I've also seen there can be race conditions that arise with certain methods. At the moment I'm not too concerned with those since again, the INSERT portion will already happen very rarely and the usage of the DB is relatively very light (though I'm sure those more experienced will tell me to build it correctly to begin with). Currently my biggest concern is performance.Any help would be appreciated and I'm happy to go into more depth on my use case if that is relevant. Thanks!"

The circles will individually have their own id's and fill that div with info from the object in the JSON that matches the id. I have tried the append method to append a SVG element to the SVG that is loaded into the document but it looks like that might not be the correct way to do it.This what a section of the SVG looks like before clickedThis is what the goal is to look like after it is clickedThe code I tried was to add a .append() with a template literal of the circle SVG code to add to the path that was clicked. The function would actually append and add to the SVG but it won't render it. This is an example of the code I was using    function addPath(clickedPath){    $(clickedPath).append(`    <circle cx=50 cy=50 r=50 />    `)}function svgLoad(){    $(#SVG).load(/src/test.svg, function(){        $(#SVG).css(width, 50vw);        $(path).on(click, function(evt) {            addPath($(this));        })    })}Is this even possible with Jquery or would this be better in something like React?"

    "contenus": [
        "Although one can use composite primary keys, for the case below, is it really a bad practice? The consensus on Stackoveflow seems to go both ways on this issue.Why?I want to store payments for the orders in a separate table. The reason is that, an order can have many items which are handled in a separate table in the form of many to many relationship. Now, if I don't use composite primary keys for my payment table, I'll lose my unique PaymentID:[PaymentId] INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,[OrderId] INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY --Also a Foreign Key--Now, if I just remove the Primary Key for the OrderId, I'll lose my one to one relationship here so Many OrderIds can be associated to many PaymentIds, and I don't want this.This seems to be why other answers on SO have concluded (mostly) that the composite key is a bad idea. If it is bad, what's the best practice then?",
        "There is no conclusion that composite primary keys are bad.The best practice is to have some column or columns that uniquely identify a row. But in some tables a single column is not enough by itself to uniquely identify a row. SQL (and the relational model) allows a composite primary key. It is a good practice is some cases. Or, another way of looking at it is that it's not a bad practice in all cases.Some people have the opinion that every table should have an integer column that automatically generates unique values, and that should serve as the primary key. Some people also claim that this primary key column should always be called id. But those are conventions, not necessarily best practices. Conventions have some benefit, because it simplifies certain decisions. But conventions are also restrictive.You may have an order with multiple payments because some people purchase on layaway, or else they have multiple sources of payment (two credit cards, for instance), or two different people want to pay for a share of the order (I frequently go to a restaurant with a friend, and we each pay for our own meal, so the staff process half of the order on each of our credit cards).I would design the system you describe as follows:Products  : product_id (PK)Orders    : order_id (PK)LineItems : product_id is (FK) to Products            order_id is (FK) to Orders            (product_id, order_id) is (PK)Payments  : order_id (FK)            payment_id - ordinal for each order_id            (order_id, payment_id) is (PK)This is also related to the concept of identifying relationship. If it's definitional that a payment exists only because an order exist, then make the order part of the primary key.Note the LineItems table also lacks its own auto-increment, single-column primary key. A many-to-many table is a classic example of a good use of a composite primary key.",
        "This question is dangerously close to asking for opinions, which can generate religious wars.  As someone who is highly biased toward having auto-increasing integer primary keys in my tables (called something like TablenameId, not Id), there is one situation where it is optional. I think the other answers address why you want primary keys.One very important reason is for reference purposes.  In a relational database, any entity could -- in theory -- be referenced by another entity via foreign key relationships.  For foreign keys, you definitely want one column to uniquely define a row.  Otherwise, you have to deal with multiple columns in different tables that align with each other.  This is possible, but cumbersome.The table you are referring to is not an entity table it is a junction table.  It is a relational database construct for handling many-to-many relationships.  Because it doesn't really represent an entity, it should not have foreign key relationships.  Hence, a composite primary key is reasonable.  There are some situations, such as when you are concerned about database size, where leaving out an artificial primary key is even desirable.",
        "Disk space is cheap, so a primary key clustered on an int identity(1,1) named after a convention (like pk + table name) is a good practice. It will make queries, joins, indexes and other constraints easy to manage. However there's one good reason to no do that (in MS SQL Server at least): if you want to manage the physical sorting of your data in the underlying storage system.The primary key clustered determines the physical sorting order. If you do it on an identity column, the physical sorting order is basically the insert order. However, this may not be the best, especially if you always query the table the same way. On very large tables, getting the right physical sorting order makes queries a lot faster. For example you may want the clustered index on a composite of two columns. ",
        "Best practices are helpful at best, but blinding at worst. Going against a best practice isn't a sin. Just be sure you know what kind of trade-off you are making.Database engines can be very complicated things. Without knowing what particular optimizations are made by a given engine, it will be difficult to determine what kinds of constructs will yield the best performance (because I assume that the issue we are talking about here is performance). Composite keys may be problematic for large tables in one kind of database, but not have any noticeable impact for another.A useful practice I've learned is to always strive for having my applications as simple as possible. Do using composite keys save you from having to perform lookups before insertions, or some other nuisance? Use them. If you, however, notice that using them makes your application no longer satisfy some significant performance requirement, consider a solution without them.",
        "From internal database engine point of view there is no obstacle to using complex primary keys. Indexing will work fine, integrity constraints will work fine, there's no performance drawback etc.In theory they are fine, but in practice there are some things (possible issues) that one should take into account:Foreign keys (FK) in related table must have multiple columns as PK. If one had simple PK, relational consistency would be easier to maintain.Many times in (web) application customer needs to select/pick up some data (retrieved from DB table). Behind each record is always PK which leads to some action. If these records are represented as web links - that is easier to maintain as links with multiple URL parameters. But if data should be selected from drop-down list, then it could be challenging to implement transfer of more parameters for PK since HTML form drop-down lists generally use only one key parameter.Generally when you deal with complex PK (multiple columns) your code should be multiplied for this columns (getters/setters), parameter transfer in application, intrusion checks etc. Finally during application development you come to conclusion that maybe it is easier to have simple PK although during DB modeling that was not an issue.",
        "If your table with a composite primary key is expected to have millions of rows, the index controlling the composite key can grow up to a point where CRUD operation performance is very degraded. In that case, it is a lot better to use a simple integer ID primary key whose index will be compact enough and establish the necessary DBE constraints to maintain uniqueness.Source:https://www.toptal.com/database/database-design-bad-practices"

        "I've been playing with functionality of CADisplayLink to programmatically monitor rendering performance in an iOS app. Also spent quite some time in Instruments, of course, but curious of what it looks like in the field and for specific screens in the app.The documentation says that a CADisplayLink timer objectallows your app to synchronize its drawing to the refresh rate of the display.which makes me expect that the provided selector is called somewhat close to vsync events emitted by the underlying hardware. Also, the timestamp property is defined as follows:The time interval that represents when the last frame displayed.So I just use the two successive callbacks to figure out the on-screen duration of the frame and decide if there was a hitch or not, like so:@objc private func handleDisplayUpdate(_ displayLink: CADisplayLink) {    defer { cachedTimestamp = displayLink.timestamp }    guard let cachedTimestamp = cachedTimestamp else { return }    let frameTime = displayLink.timestamp - cachedTimestamp    if frameTime > aThreshold {      // do something lightweight    }}By using CACurrentMediaTime() call I can see that the handler is called pretty close to what the latest timestamp holds, so it is 1ms-ish behind the recent frame update. However the frameTime intervals are not always a multiple of 16.67ms (assuming the device renders @60fps): while scrolling I can observe the numbers being e.g. 25ms or 43ms.Given that frames are swapped onto the display at vsync points in time only, does the above mean that the timestamp property actually represents something else in the whole render loop?"
