        "I'm trying to write a simple python server that accepts a connection from whatever and digests the entire frame, down to the ethernet headers. The server will not maintain a connection or care about the client once it receives the frame. I'm sort of going for a frame visualizer, think wireshark, but the server creates that visualization, which isn't a part of this question.If I use a traditional AF_INET/SOCK_STREAM socket for this server, the only data I receive from clients will be the data payload itself. With an AF_INET/SOCK_RAW socket, I will get Layer 3 headers, Layer 4 headers, and the data. See this question for a better explanation on that.With an AF_PACKET/SOCK_RAW socket, I would in theory get all the rest of the goodies down to the ethernet headers and be able to receive those, and digest them to my heart's content. The problem, I think, is that when using SOCK_RAW you're essentially telling your NIC that you don't want to handle any of the setup of the connection. This is a problem because I want a client to be able to send TCP data / open a connection (or UDP or whatever else), have the server capture that request(s), and then do whatever with the ethernet headers the client sends to be used in a visualization. For now I'm content with one frame at a time, but I'd like to be able to do multiple in a series at a later date, which means I need connections to work.Here's the issue: With a SOCK_RAW, the server would also need to handle the entire TCP handshake, or any other process that happens. That's out of scope for this project and I really just want to capture the entire frame of a request, I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel. Is AF_PACKET/SOCK_RAW what I'm actually looking for, or is there another way to capture the entire L2->L7 request?Here's an example of a would-be client.py, sending basic data over a TCP socket:import socketHOST = '192.168.0.95'PORT = 5000with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:    s.connect((HOST, PORT))    s.sendall(b'Hello, world')Predictably, this works for a normal echo server. Here's the server.py, which I've been toying with and is otherwise garbage code. I would like to get the whole OSI onion from the client above, for example.server.pyimport socketPORT = 5000ETH_P_ALL = 3ETH_P_IP = 0x800 # These two were stolen from some other answer, not sures = socket.socket(socket.AF_PACKET, socket.SOCK_RAW, socket.htons(ETH_P_ALL))s.bind(('wlp0s20f3', 5000)) # Bind RAW socket to this specific interface, I guess# Since raw sockets bind on an interface and not an address# Note: Loopback (lo) usually gave me broken pipe / connection refused errors,# this one seems to work (read: not break)while True:    print(s.recvfrom(4096))The server sits patiently and waits for incoming data, which it never receives. The client, upon executing, gets a ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused.I have tried getting some data on the wire with a client AF_PACKET/SOCK_RAW socket instead of a TCP socket, and while it does get on the wire and is visible with wireshark (unlike the simple client above), the server still doesn't see the data or receive anything at all."

        "Rendering text to screen such that it is editable seems to me to be a delicate operation.Usually this is not a big deal for good text editors with small amounts of text upto even 8MB as modern processors have gotten faster and more efficient. However, this starts posing a problem the moment a huge amount of text warrants rendering.Case in point, the classic Windows Notepad perhaps does not implement chunk by chunk loading and tries to load the entire file text content and send it to render all at once, causing GUI thread block even on moderately sized files.If one were to read file via a buffer, and on each read send that text to render and clear the buffer itself for the next read, it becomes noticably faster, and RAM efficient - and if the process is run on another thread, the GUI won't even block and the whole thing is much smoother.I would think to enter some text in the middle of a bunch of text in some GUI textarea of some sort, the under the hood implementation would be some form of memmove to shift the right side content to make space while only updating the visible section on the screen. Is this somewhat a correct idea?In case of HTML and JavaScript though (for example in a textarea), some people usually perform a string division, append the content to the first part, then append in the last part and set the entire resulting string = to textarea.value which seems heavily inefficient on the surface.Is this process for browser text updates as inefficient as it appears to me? Do browsers implement these direct assigning to internal HTML internally?"

        "My JavaFX application needs to be able to find the FXML files to load them with the FXMLLoader, as well as stylesheets (CSS files) and images. When I try to load these, I often get errors, or the item I'm trying to load simply doesn't load at runtime.For FXML files, the error message I see includesCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: location is not setFor images, the stack trace includesCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid URL: Invalid URL or resource not foundHow do I figure out the correct resource path for these resources?",
        "Short version of answer:Use getClass().getResource(...) or SomeOtherClass.class.getResource(...) to create a URL to the resourcePass either an absolute path (with a leading /) or a relative path (without a leading /) to the getResource(...) method. The path is the package containing the resource, with . replaced with /.Do not use .. in the resource path. If and when the application is bundled as a jar file, this will not work. If the resource is not in the same package or in a subpackage of the class, use an absolute path.For FXML files, pass the URL directly to the FXMLLoader.For images and stylesheets, call toExternalForm() on the URL to generate the String to pass to the Image or ImageView constructor, or to add to the stylesheets list.To troubleshoot, examine the content of your build folder (or jar file), not your source folder.Placing src in the path when you get a resource is always wrong. The src directory is only available at development and build time, not at deployment and runtime.Full AnswerContentsScope of this answerResources are loaded at runtimeJavaFX uses URLs to load resourcesRules for resource namesCreating a resource URL with getClass().getResource(...)Organizing code and resourcesMaven (and similar) standard layoutsTroubleshootingScope of this answerNote that this answer only addresses loading resources (for example FXML files, images, and stylesheets) that are part of the application, and bundled with it. So, for example, loading images that the user chooses from the file system on the machine on which the application is running would require different techniques that are not covered here.Resources are loaded at runtimeThe first thing to understand about loading resources is that they, of course, are loaded at runtime. Typically, during development, an application is run from the file system: that is, the class files and resources required to run it are individual files on the file system. However, once the application is built, it is usually executed from a jar file. In this case, the resources such as FXML files, stylesheets, and images, are no longer individual files on the filesystem but are entries in the jar file. Therefore:Code cannot use File, FileInputStream, or file: URLs to load a resourceJavaFX uses URLs to load resourcesJavaFX loads FXML, Images, and CSS stylesheets using URLs.The FXMLLoader explicitly expects a java.net.URL object to be passed to it (either to the static FXMLLoader.load(...) method, to the FXMLLoader constructor, or to the setLocation() method).Both Image and Scene.getStylesheets().add(...) expect Strings that represent URLs. If URLs are passed without a scheme, they are interpreted relative to the classpath. These strings can be created from a URL in a robust way by calling toExternalForm() on the URL.The recommended mechanism for creating the correct URL for a resource is to use Class.getResource(...), which is called on an appropriate Class instance. Such a class instance can be obtained by calling getClass() (which gives the class of the current object), or ClassName.class. The Class.getResource(...) method takes a String representing the resource name.Rules for resource namesResource names are /-separated path names. Each component represents a package or sub-package name component.Resource names are case-sensitive.The individual components in the resource name must be valid Java identifiersThe last point has an important consequence:. and .. are not valid Java identifiers, so they cannot be used in resource names.These may actually work when the application is running from the filesystem, though this is really more of an accident of the implementation of getResource(). They will fail when the application is bundled as a jar file.Similarly, if you are running on an operating system that does not distinguish between filenames that differ only by case, then using the wrong case in a resource name might work while running from the filesystem, but will fail when running from a jar file.Resource names beginning with a leading / are absolute: in other words they are interpreted relative to the classpath. Resource names without a leading / are interpreted relative to the class on which getResource() was called.A slight variation on this is to use getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(...). The path supplied to ClassLoader.getResource(...) must not begin with a / and is always absolute, i.e. it is relative to the classpath. It should also be noted that in modular applications, access to resources using ClassLoader.getResource() is, under some circumstances, subject to rules of strong encapsulation, and additionally the package containing the resource must be opened unconditionally. See the documentation for details.Creating a resource URL with getClass().getResource()To create a resource URL, use someClass.getResource(...). Usually, someClass represents the class of the current object, and is obtained using getClass(). However, this doesn't have to be the case, as described in the next section.If the resource is in the same package as the current class, or in a subpackage of that class, use a relative path to the resource: // FXML file in the same package as the current class: URL fxmlURL = getClass().getResource(MyFile.fxml); Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(fxmlURL); // FXML file in a subpackage called `fxml`: URL fxmlURL2 = getClass().getResource(fxml/MyFile.fxml); Parent root2 = FXMLLoader.load(fxmlURL2); // Similarly for images: URL imageURL = getClass().getResource(myimages/image.png); Image image = new Image(imageURL.toExternalForm());If the resource is in a package that is not a subpackage of the current class, use an absolute path. For example, if the current class is in the package org.jamesd.examples.view, and we need to load a CSS file style.css which is in the package org.jamesd.examples.css, we have to use an absolute path: URL cssURL = getClass().getResource(/org/jamesd/examples/css/style.css); scene.getStylesheets().add(cssURL.toExternalForm());It's worth re-emphasizing for this example that the path ../css/style.css does not contain valid Java resource names, and will not work if the application is bundled as a jar file.Organizing code and resourcesI recommend organizing your code and resources into packages determined by the part of the UI they are associated with. The following source layout in Eclipse gives an example of this organization:Using this structure, each resource has a class in the same package, so it is easy to generate the correct URL for any resource:FXMLLoader editorLoader = new FXMLLoader(EditorController.class.getResource(Editor.fxml));Parent editor = editorLoader.load();FXMLLoader sidebarLoader = new FXMLLoader(SidebarController.class.getResource(Sidebar.fxml));Parent sidebar = sidebarLoader.load();ImageView logo = new ImageView();logo.setImage(newImage(SidebarController.class.getResource(logo.png).toExternalForm()));mainScene.getStylesheets().add(App.class.getResource(style.css).toExternalForm());If you have a package with only resources and no classes, for example, the images package in the layout belowyou can even consider creating a marker interface solely for the purposes of looking up the resource names:package org.jamesd.examples.sample.images ;public interface ImageLocation { }which now lets you find these resources easily:Image clubs = new Image(ImageLocation.class.getResource(clubs.png).toExternalForm());Loading resources from a subpackage of a class is also reasonably straightforward. Given the following layout:we can load resources in the App class as follows:package org.jamesd.examples.resourcedemo;import java.net.URL;import javafx.application.Application;import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;import javafx.scene.Parent;import javafx.scene.Scene;import javafx.stage.Stage;public class App extends Application {    @Override    public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {                        URL fxmlResource = getClass().getResource(fxml/MainView.fxml);                Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(fxmlResource);        Scene scene = new Scene(root);        scene.getStylesheets().add(getClass().getResource(style/main-style.css).toExternalForm());        primaryStage.setScene(scene);        primaryStage.show();    }        public static void main(String[] args) {        Application.launch(args);    }}To load resources which are not in the same package, or a subpackage, of the class from which you're loading them, you need to use the absolute path:    URL fxmlResource = getClass().getResource(/org/jamesd/examples/resourcedemo/fxml/MainView.fxml);Maven (and similar) standard layoutsMaven and other dependency management and build tools recommend a source folder layout in which resources are separated from Java source files, as per the Maven Standard Directory Layout. The Maven layout version of the previous example looks like:It is important to understand how this is built to assemble the application:*.java files in the source folder src/main/java are compiled to class files, which are deployed to the build folder or jar file.Resources in the resource folder src/main/resources are copied to the build folder or jar file.In this example, because the resources are in folders that correspond to subpackages of the packages where the source code is defined, the resulting build (which, by default with Maven, is in target/classes) consists of a single structure.Note that both src/main/java and src/main/resources are considered the root for the corresponding structure in the build, so only their content, not the folders themselves, are part of the build. In other words, there is no resources folder available at runtime. The build structure is shown below in the troubleshooting section.Notice that the IDE in this case (Eclipse) displays the src/main/java source folder differently from the src/main/resources folder; in the first case it displays packages, but for the resource folder it displays folders. Make sure you know if you are creating packages (whose names are .-delimited) or folders (whose names must not contain ., or any other character not valid in a Java identifier) in your IDE.If you are using Maven and decide that for ease of maintenance you'd rather keep your .fxml files next to the .java files that reference them (instead of sticking strictly to the Maven Standard Directory Layout), you can do so. Just tell Maven to copy these files to the same folder in your output directory that it will place the class files generated from those source files into, by including something like the following in your pom.xml file:    <build>        ...        <resource>            <directory>src/main/java</directory>            <includes>                <include>**/*.fxml</include>                <include>**/*.css</include>            </includes>        </resource>        ...    </build>If you do this, you can then use an approach like FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource(MyFile.fxml)) to have your classes load .fxml resources from the directory which contains their own .class files.TroubleshootingIf you get errors you do not expect, first check the following:Make sure you are not using invalid names for your resources. This includes using . or .. in the resource path.Make sure you are using relative paths where expected, and absolute paths where expected. for Class.getResource(...) the path is absolute if it has a leading /, and relative otherwise. For ClassLoader.getResource(...), the path is always absolute, and must not start with a /.Remember that absolute paths are defined relative to the classpath. Typically the root of the classpath is the union of all source and resource folders in your IDE.If all this seems correct, and you still see errors, check the build or deployment folder. The exact location of this folder will vary by IDE and build tool. If you are using Maven, by default it is target/classes. Other build tools and IDEs will deploy to folders named bin, classes, build, or out.Often, your IDE will not show the build folder, so you may need to check it with the system file explorer.The combined source and build structure  for the Maven example above isIf you are generating a jar file, some IDEs may allow you to expand the jar file in a tree view to inspect its contents. You can also check the contents from the command line with jar tf file.jar:$ jar -tf resource-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar META-INF/META-INF/MANIFEST.MForg/org/jamesd/org/jamesd/examples/org/jamesd/examples/resourcedemo/org/jamesd/examples/resourcedemo/images/org/jamesd/examples/resourcedemo/style/org/jamesd/examples/resourcedemo/fxml/org/jamesd/examples/resourcedemo/images/so-logo.pngorg/jamesd/examples/resourcedemo/style/main-style.cssorg/jamesd/examples/resourcedemo/Controller.classorg/jamesd/examples/resourcedemo/fxml/MainView.fxmlorg/jamesd/examples/resourcedemo/App.classmodule-info.classMETA-INF/maven/META-INF/maven/org.jamesd.examples/META-INF/maven/org.jamesd.examples/resource-demo/META-INF/maven/org.jamesd.examples/resource-demo/pom.xmlMETA-INF/maven/org.jamesd.examples/resource-demo/pom.properties$ If the resources are not being deployed, or are being deployed to an unexpected location, check the configuration of your build tool or IDE.Example image loading troubleshooting codeThis code is deliberately more verbose than is strictly necessarily to facilitate adding additional debugging information for the image loading process.  It also uses System.out rather than a logger for easier portability.String resourcePathString = /img/wumpus.png;Image image = loadImage(resourcePathString);// ...private Image loadImage(String resourcePathString) {    System.out.println(Attempting to load an image from the resourcePath:  + resourcePathString);    URL resource = HelloApplication.class.getResource(resourcePathString);    if (resource == null) {        System.out.println(Resource does not exist:  + resourcePathString);        return null;    }    String path = resource.toExternalForm();    System.out.println(Image path:  + path);    Image image = new Image(path);    System.out.println(Image load error?   + image.isError());    System.out.println(Image load exception?  + image.getException());    if (!image.isError()) {        System.out.println(Successfully loaded an image from  + resourcePathString);    }    return image;}External Tutorial ReferenceA useful external tutorial for resource location is Eden coding's tutorial:Where to put resource files in JavaFX.The nice thing about the Eden coding tutorial is that it is comprehensive.  In addition to covering the information on lookups from Java code which is in this question.  The Eden tutorial covers topics such as locating resources that are encoded as urls in CSS, or resource references in FXML using an @ specifier or fx:include element (which are topics currently not directly covered in this answer)."

    "contenus": [
        "I've created a simple chrome extension to place a download button over any image that you hover your mouse over. The problem is the positioning of this icon is based on the location of the hovered image at the time of mouseover, so if you scroll and your cursor stays hovered on the image as the scroll happens, the icon stays visible but does not follow the scroll because it's position is just static until you stop hovering and it goes away. I made a picture to more easily explain. I'm trying to have the icon follow the corresponding image if you scroll while keeping your cursor hovered.Hover before and after scrollThe problem is that I cannot just give it position: absolute because ideally I can use this on any website and I cannot always account for the parent div attributes. So I position based on the location on the page at the time hover.    let left= img.get(0).getBoundingClientRect().left+10,         top= img.get(0).getBoundingClientRect().top+10;    $('body').prepend(`            <img id=ext-emp-download src=${chrome.runtime.getURL(img/down.png)} style=width:45px !important;height:45px !important;position:fixed;z-index:123456789;border-radius:20px;margin-top:${top}px;left:${left}px>`)        any suggestions on what I can add to this to make it function better or  have the icon follow the image with the scroll?",
        "Stop using margin-top, use top instead and use position:absolute instead of fixed, also since it seems you are already using jQuery (?), use jQuery:s offset-method to calculate the placement rather than getBoundingClientRect:let left = img.offset().left + 10, top = img.offset().top + 10;  $('body').prepend(`  <img id=ext-emp-download src=${chrome.runtime.getURL(img/down.png)} style=width:45px !important;height:45px !important;position:absolute;z-index:123456789;border-radius:20px;top:${top}px;left:${left}px>`)",
        "Use position: absolute; and make parent position: relative; then icon will folow parent.",
        "I don't think there's a good solution for this especially if you want to account for all possible scenarios of the parent element.However, instead of appending your element to the body element, you can choose to append to the .scrollParent() of the img tag instead. This makes sure the position of it is dependent on the element that is scrolling. In addition, position: fixed is probably not what you want given that once the user scroll, you have to manually update its position.An alternative approach is you can make use of context menu instead: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/contextMenus/, this allow user to right-click and select your extension for Download for instance."

        "Solid needs to chain function calls to preserve reactivity from parent to child. When you destructure props you will be assigning values to static variables hence removing reactivity. So, in your child component you need to use property access like so: pros.id.Only reactive values get updated, so you need to use a store or signal to store values that changes over time and pass them as props.https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/introduction_signalshttps://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/props_defaultsMaking sure you pass reactive values as props.Once you done that you can use the destructuring utility from @solid-primitives library that relays values through proxy object as an alternative to property access:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solid-primitives/destructureAnother alternative would be using a babel plugin that undoes the object destructuring during transpilation process.

Anyways, here’s my logic. Let’s assume that the word I’m trying to guess is STOLE. Basically for each letter, I first check to see if there are two or more instances of the same letter in the guess (this is the problem of duplicates that I’ve been trying to solve, my logic is probably flawed though but this is what I came up with). I thought this would be a good idea since if there are two of the same letters in the guess like the T in LATTE, I would check the first T, giving it the green highlight, and then preventing the second T from getting a yellow highlight. Here’s the code in action:Here’s an instance of where it doesn’t seem to go as planned:<- the problem is with my guess trees. The code is saying that there are two E’s in the final word, but if you look at the end, OFTEN only has one E.Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!This code is my attempt at trying to account for duplicates. I tried integrating a counter but that doesn’t seem to work. I think the error lies in the fundamentals of my logic but I can’t pinpoint where exactly.",

        "There is an error message that I encountered when trying to run the vagrant --version command in my terminal: bash: vagrant: command not found. This error message indicates that Vagrant, a command-line tool for managing virtual machines, is either not installed on my system or not in my system's PATH. I need help in resolving this issue so that I can successfully run Vagrant commands on my system.The error message bash: vagrant: command not found means that the Vagrant command-line tool is not installed on your system, or it is not in your system's PATH.To install Vagrant, you need to follow these steps:Download the appropriate Vagrant installer for your operating system from the official Vagrant website: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.Run the installer and follow the instructions provided to complete the installation.After the installation is complete, open a new terminal window and try running the vagrant --version command again to verify that Vagrant is installed and working.If you have already installed Vagrant but are still getting the command not found error, it is possible that the Vagrant executable is not in your system's PATH. In that case, you need to add the directory where Vagrant is installed to your system's PATH.The specific steps for adding a directory to your system's PATH depend on your operating system.WindowsOpen the Start menu and search for Environment Variables.Click on Edit the system environment variables.Click on the Environment Variables button.Under System variables, scroll down until you find the Path variable and select it.Click on the Edit button.Click on the New button and enter the path to the directory where Vagrant is installed. The default path is C:\\HashiCorp\\Vagrant\\bin.Click OK to close all the windows.After you have added the directory to your system's PATH, you should be able to use the vagrant command in a new terminal window.macOSOpen Terminal.Type nano ~/.bash_profile and press Enter.Add the following line to the end of the file: export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/vagrant/bin (replace /path/to/vagrant/bin with the actual path to the Vagrant bin directory).Press Ctrl+O to save the file and Ctrl+X to exit nano.Type source ~/.bash_profile to apply the changes to your current Terminal session.After you have added the directory to your system's PATH, you should be able to use the vagrant command in a new terminal window.LinuxOpen Terminal.Type nano ~/.bashrc and press Enter.Add the following line to the end of the file: export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/vagrant/bin (replace /path/to/vagrant/bin with the actual path to the Vagrant bin directory).Press Ctrl+O to save the file and Ctrl+X to exit nano.Type source ~/.bashrc to apply the changes to your current Terminal session.After you have added the directory to your system's PATH, you should be able to use the vagrant command in a new terminal window."

        "I'm trying to create a desktop app using the electron-react boilerplate on GitHub and at the moment, I'm trying to create routes for the multiple pages I intend to use for the app. I looked up how to do so, and I saw that I could use useNavigate(), onClick for the button, and Routes, Router, and Route from React. However, it isn't working.I've attempted nesting the Route components so that the home page has the welcome page appended to it, which could get replaced with the login page on the button click, but that didn't work. Then, I tried listing the Route components instead, and that didn't work either. I tried looking up other posts about this issue, but nothing they had helped. I also tried switching out the useNavigate import to originate from react-router instead of react-router-dom, but that didn't work either.Here is the code I've been working with so far:import * as React from 'react';import { MemoryRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'import { useNavigate } from 'react-router';import TitleBar from './COMPONENTS/title_bar.js'import perspective_grid from '../../assets/images/perspective_grid.jpg'import './App.css'import './CSS/Home.css'// grid background with overlaying gradientfunction Background() {  return (    <div id = background>      <img className = prevent-select prevent-drag absolute id = perspective-grid src={perspective_grid}></img>    </div>  )}// welcome page (with login and signup buttons)function Welcome() {  let navigate = useNavigate('/login')  return (    <div id = welcome>      <h1 className = prevent-select title>WTBDSB</h1>      <p  id = subtitle><i><b>w</b>ants <b>t</b>o <b>b</b>e <b>d</b>esmos <b>s</b>o <b>b</b>ad</i></p>      <button className = btn prevent-drag id = login onClick={navigate}>log in</button>      <button className = btn prevent-drag id = signup>sign up</button>    </div>  )}// login pagefunction Login() {  return (    <div id = LOGIN>testtesttest</div>  )}// signup pagefunction Signup() {  return (    <div id = SIGNUP></div>  )}// full routing for the above pages.export default function App() {  return (    <Router>            <Routes>        <Route path=/ element={<>          <TitleBar />          <Background />          <Welcome />        </>} />        <Route path=login element={<Login />} />        </Routes>    </Router>  )}And here is the error I'm getting (after I'm clicking the log in button):Any help would be really appreciated - this is my first time working with Routes in React, and I'd love to be able to get this working so I can make more progress."
